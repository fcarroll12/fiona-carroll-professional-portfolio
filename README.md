# fiona-carroll-professional-portfolio

## Description

I created this Professional Portfolio so I have a platform to display my future work and become more employable for future job prospects. I also created it so I have one single platform whereas I can upload work to showcase my skills. This webpage showcases skills in Javscript, CSS/HTML, jQuery, MySQL, Node.js and Express.js. I am struggling with providing a direct link to my work when you hover over each project image. For now, you may access all of my work through my GitHub Profile linked and located at the bottom of my page.
